    ---

    Lite XL is super lightweight;
    10 MB of RAM and no GPU requirements at all.
    If your platform is supported by SDL2, **it will work**.

-   :material-lightning-bolt:{ .lg .middle } **Powerful**

    Lite XL is powerful and has many features of a "modern" text editor.
    Multiline editing, autocomplete and pane splitting are supported by default.

-   :material-magnify:{ .lg .middle } **Hackable**

-   :material-code-tags:{ .lg .middle } **Customizable**

    ---
    
    Lite XL is extremely customizable, completely scriptable with Lua.
    In fact, most of Lite XL is written entirely in Lua, C is only
    used when necessary.

-   :material-connection:{ .lg .middle } **Hyperextensible**

    ---

    If Lite XL doesn't provide a feature you want, it's probably available
    with a plugin. Add and remove features from your editor at will.
