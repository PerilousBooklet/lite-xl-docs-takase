# Setup Lite XL as an IDE

Lite XL can be configured to be a proper IDE for many programming languages.

The following features can be enabled through a combination of installed plugins and configuration instructions inside Lite XL's `init.lua`:

- Syntax highlighting
- Smart autocompletion
- Error highlighting
- Code snippets
- Integrated terminal
- VSCode-like minimap
- Git integration
- Document symbols treeview
- And much more...

There is an attempt at setting up a configuration for C/C++ [here][1], with custom plugins for building and debugging.

There is also an attempt at setting up a configuration for many other languages [here][2].
