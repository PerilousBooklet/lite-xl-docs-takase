# API Overview

> **Note**
> This is a work in progress.

These pages provide some guidance on how to use various Lite XL APIs.
We assume that you are familiar with [Lua] as the guides can be
quite technical.

These pages only contain important or frequently used features.
You can find documentation for a component in [Lite XL's repository].
For instance, the documentation for `View` can be found in
`data/core/view.lua`.
For C APIs, you can find documentation in the [`docs/api` folder].
